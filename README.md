# SUPERMARKET_STORE_SALES DATASET DOWNLOADED FROM KAGGLE TO CARRY OUT ANALYSIS USING PANDAS LIBRARY ON JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.

THE DATASET PROVIDES SALES AND PROFIT DATA FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS ACROSS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND REGIONS

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND IDENTIFY ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS THAT COULD HELP THE COMPANY IMPROVE ITS BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

WE STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HIGH SALES IN THE SUPERMARKET STORE BY ASKING SOME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND TESTING SOME FORMULATED HYPOTHESES BEFORE AND DURING THE ANALYSIS TO EXTRACT ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS.

WE ALSO TRY TO DROP UNNECESSARY COLUMNS IN OUR DATASET FOR SEAMLESS ANALYSIS

# COMMUNICATE RESULTS

FROM THE ABOVE ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS HAVE THE HIGHEST PROFITS MARGIN COMPARED TO OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

PROFITS ARE HIGHER ON WEEKDAYS THAN ON WEEKENDS, AND SALES ARE ALSO HIGHER DURING CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

SAME-DAY ORDER SHIPPING HAS THE LOWEST RATE OF RETURNED PRODUCTS. ALBEIT, THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE EAST REGION RECORDS THE HIGHEST SALES COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE DATASET

VALUABLE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED TO AID THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE AND ALSO TO HELP GUIDE THE FUTURE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT FURTHER ANALYSIS MAY BE REQUIRED TO GRASP SOME UNDERLYING FACTORS INFLUENCING THESE OBSERVATIONS.

# FURTHER SUGGESTIONS

DEEPER FOCUS ON DEVELOPING AND PROMOTING TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTS TO BOOST ITS PROFITS

REGIONS WITH HIGHEST SALES SHOULD HAVE MORE FOCUS TO MAXIMIZE FUTURE HIGH SALES. PRIORITY SHOULD ALSO BE ON RE-EVALUATING ITS MARKETING AND SALES CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES IN OTHER REGIONS.

TOP FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING SALES DURING THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. INVENTORY INCREMENT OF POPULAR PRODUCTS DURING THIS TIME SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY, INCLUDING RUNNING TARGETED CAMPAIGNS, PROMOTIONS, AND DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS.

ALBEIT, THE COMPANY SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER STRATEGIES TO MAINTAIN SALES DURING OTHER MONTHS, SUCH AS INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, PROMOTIONS, AND DISCOUNTS IN SLOWER MONTHS.

THE SUPERSTORE COMPANY COULD CONSIDER OFFERING MORE SAME-DAY OPTIONS TO CUSTOMERS. THIS MIGHT INVOLVE OPTIMIZING INVENTORY AND SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS CAN BE SHIPPED QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

THEY COULD ALSO CONSIDER FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMOTIONS OR SALES DURING THE WEEKENDS TO INCREASE SALES BY OFFERING WEEKEND-ONLY PROMOTIONS, DISCOUNTS, OR TARGETED MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AIMED AT WEEKEND CUSTOMERS.

THEY COULD ALSO CONSIDER OFFERING SPECIAL EVENTS, IN-STORE ACTIVITIES ON WEEKENDS TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS AND INCREASE SALES.
